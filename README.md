# SOC-Midterm-Submission
For the first three weeks, our tasks were to learn HTML, CSS and JS, and create a simple website with some functionality using JS. Since I already knew HTML and CSS and the basics of Javascript, I studied the more intermediate JS stuff provided in the resources by the mentor. After the first week, I built two simple websites, the Palindrome Checker and the Roman Numeral Converter. During the last week, I have been making the calculator. It still does not have complete functionality of a calculator, but it does evaluate if provided a proper expression.
Through this course, my main focus has been to mostly learn more about Javascript, until further resources are provided by our mentor. The new things I learnt are arrow functions, OOP in JS and some new methods, which I applied in my projects. I also learnt about catching errors and fetching, but I have not applied them in my projects. 
My basics in web-development itself have improved a lot throughout this term. I can apply more functionality to my projects using JS than I was able to previously. Basically I am now pretty comfortable with designing a website and adding functionality to it, and I can learn further in this field, such as frameworks, like three.js, which is the main focus of this SOC project.
